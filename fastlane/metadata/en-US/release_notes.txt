In this release you can have badge on your app icon which will represent items in your default list view (if it's the unread list, you'll have a badge with the number of unread items, etc.). This feature can be disabled in settings.
We fixed some bugs, like articles in list which doesn't match the selected filter and some problem with theme.
Share extension are completly reworked and should work everywhere now !
Article list is now more clear and a tap on the title will scroll up to the top.
wallabag is now available on iOS 9.0 too (we care about people using that old iOS from 1 year and a half)
